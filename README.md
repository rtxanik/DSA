# DSA Practice

Years ago, I came to the conclusion that I wouldn’t be able to escape doing LeetCode, and that I should practice at least one problem a day. 


Turns out, I was right, and this repository is where I finally took my own advice.

My DSA practice notes and solutions will be posted here, should I ever need to revisit them.
