Some highly rated questions often have unintuitive optimal solutions.

Some other popular questions have simple optimal solutions, but the algorithm might fail to address another aspect of the problem.
Consider the solution forLeetCode 334: Increasing Triplet Subsequence. It is a correct algorithm for the problem specification given on LeetCode, but try to print the indices for the test case [1, 5, 2, 0, 3], and you will notice that the output is incorrect. 

It is best to not dwell on these questions and just memorize them.
